<Accordion title="Summarizing a transcript">
To get a transcript summary, simply ask Rogo to summarize. As before, clicking on a footnote brings you to the exact source of that information from the transcript.

<Accordion title="Targeted questions on transcripts">
Summaries are just the tip of the iceberg. Rogo is a personal analyst on steroids. For example, you can just ask Rogo to: ***”compare verizon and at&t's most recent earnings in terms of how they are talking about net adds & customer churn.”***

<Accordion title="Pulling numbers from across transcripts">
Rogo makes spreading metrics over time for a company super easy. Here we just ask: ***“spread proctor and gamble's organic sales growth from their 4 most recent earnings calls.”***
