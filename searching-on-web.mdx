Rogo can surf the web for you and aggregate information with sources. All you do is give it a command into the search bar.

<Accordion title="Writing a search">
Say you’re researching the market penetration of some gig economy companies in different geographies. All you have to do is ask Rogo: ***“make a table of doordash's market share across new york, san francisco, LA, and boston.”***

<Accordion title="Looking at sources">
Every piece of information Rogo returns always has a link to the source it got it from. To verify information for yourself and decide if it’s trustworthy, just click on the footnote.

<Accordion title="Writing a follow-up">
You can always follow up on a Rogo query. Here we just ask Rogo to add a year column to the table. We find out the San Francisco data is from 2021, not 2023.
