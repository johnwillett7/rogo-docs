title: 'Searching on Financial Data'
---

In addition to the text data we’ve been searching so far, you can also search on numeric data through Rogo. In this example, we’re using a source “Finance Data,” which is connected to an API with market data and fundamental data. For you, this will be whichever market data vendor you use – FactSet, CapIQ, etc.

If you don’t have access to market data and you want to add your market data vendor, email [john@rogodata.com](mailto:john@rogodata.com).

You search this data in the same way. Here we type: ***”graph performance of car companies since tesla released the model 3.”*** Rogo returns a graph of stock performance for Tesla, GM, Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen since July 2017 (when the Model 3 was released).
