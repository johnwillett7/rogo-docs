<Accordion title="What are my firm’s options for partnering with Rogo?">
In terms of data the options are:

1. All external data – our off-the-shelf version, with no adjustments
2. All external data – bespoke deployment with your firm: custom data integrations, branded exports, etc.
3. External and internal data – includes firm proprietary materials (PowerPoints, PDFs, Excels, etc.)

For deployment we can do both

1. Rogo’s cloud (AWS); or
2. Your technical infrastructure (Docker container in your private cloud, on-prem, etc.)

<Accordion title="How can Rogo be customized for my firm?">
This onboarding document only discusses the data sources in our public, off-the-shelf product. When we partner with your firm, we’ll connect all the data you actually work with every day:

- Broker research
- Other filings (8-Ks, etc.)
- Market data (FactSet, etc.)
- Alternative data

And that’s just external data. We also connect firms’ proprietary internal data – PowerPoints, PDFs, etc.

Beyond data sources, we also offer customized:

- Branded PowerPoint / Excel exports
- Exports to workflow tools (Slack, Teams, Outlook, etc.)
- Auth & permissioning
- Deployments in your technical infrastructure

<Accordion title="How do I export answers from Rogo?">
At the bottom of every response in Rogo, you can click “Export” and choose between these options:

1. Email: This exports the information to your email provider, automatically adding sources.
2. PowerPoint Slide (1 Page): This exports the information to a single PowerPoint slide.
3. PowerPoint Slide Deck (2+ Pages): This exports the information to multiple PowerPoint slides. This is useful for creating a shell of a deck based on the information.

In addition, when your answer contains a table, you can click “Download CSV” to export the information directly to a CSV.
